# GraphQuest: Exploring and Implementing GraphQL

A comprehensive learning journey through GraphQL fundamentals and frontend integration using the Rick and Morty API.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into three progressive phases:

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 0: GraphQL Fundamentals (`alx-graphql-0x00`)
- Basic GraphQL queries for characters and episodes
- Understanding query arguments and pagination
- Hands-on with GraphQL syntax and structure

### ðŸš€ Phase 1: Frontend Setup (`alx-graphql-0x01`)
- Next.js application setup with TypeScript
- Apollo Client configuration
- GraphQL endpoint integration

### ðŸ’« Phase 2: Full Application (`alx-graphql-0x02`)
- Complete React components with GraphQL queries
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Pagination and state management

## Learning Objectives

- **GraphQL Query Construction**: Write precise queries with specific fields
- **API Integration**: Connect React applications to GraphQL endpoints
- **State Management**: Handle loading states, errors, and pagination
- **Type Safety**: Implement TypeScript interfaces for GraphQL data

## Tech Stack
